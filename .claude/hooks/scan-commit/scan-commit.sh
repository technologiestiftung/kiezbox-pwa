# scan-commit.sh — Claude Code PreToolUse hook (matcher: Bash).
#
# Fires when Claude runs a Bash command. If the command is `git commit`,
# scans the staged diff for secret patterns (shared with scan-secrets.sh)
# and blocks (exit 2) on match. For all other commands, exits 0.
#
# This closes the gap left by scan-secrets.sh: the prompt-submit scanner
# only catches pasted credentials; this hook catches secrets that Claude
# writes into code and then tries to commit.
